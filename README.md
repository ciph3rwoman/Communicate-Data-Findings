Lyft Bikes - Formerly known as Ford GoBike System Data 

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full yearâ€™s coverage is desired.
