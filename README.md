## 1. Description

Formerly known as Ford GoBikes, renamed Lyft Bikes is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. In this investigation, I've looked at the bike ride trends and biker type of the bay Ford GoBike Share system. The main focus was on biking duration, the time (weekday, hour), and the bike types.

## 2. Summary of Findings

* In 2019, 80.6% of the user types in the Ford GoBikes sharing platform were Subscribers. 19.4% of the user types in the Ford GoBikes Sharing Platform were Customers.
* Subscribers that are using Ford GoBike which are primarily daily commuters who rent a bike on weekdays around 8-9am and 5-6pm.
* Customers are casually using the Ford GoBikes which mainly occur from Friday through to Sunday.

## Key Insights for Presentation
<a name="key"></a>
In the Bay Area, July which is in Summer in the Northen Hemispher is the most popular time to use the Ford Go Bike sharing system. March is also the second most popular time to use the Ford Go Bike sharing system in the Bay Area.

While December which is Winter time in the Northern Hemisphere, is the least popular time to use the Ford Go Bike Sharing System. Therefore, there will be more bikes available due to the usuage of bikes not been used around the Christmas Holidays.
